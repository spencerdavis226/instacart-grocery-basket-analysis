## Project overview
This project turns raw Instacart order/product/customer tables into a reusable analytic dataset, then explores:
- shopping peaks (day-of-week / time-of-day),
- product/category patterns,
- customer behavior signals (e.g., reorder habits),
- and segment differences that support business recommendations.

**Where to find results:** The complete set of results and recommendations live in `report/Instacart_Final_Report.xlsx` (see “Start here” above).
